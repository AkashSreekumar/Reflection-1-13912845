# My 13912845 Reflective Portfolio 

## Week 1 Reflection

### What have I learnt this week?

This week we learnt an introduction to systems and complex / adaptive systems and its impact on the modern world of Information systems. This included the fundamental understanding of an actual system and its purpose. Upon discussion in class and doing discussion homework I learnt that systems are being used everywhere around us. It can help companies and groups e.g. bees have a higher chance of survival and performance. Through our workshop case study homework, I learnt that not only do humans use systems but also insects. An example of this is bees who have a complex adaptive system where to influence their hives temperature they constantly have to flap their wings together. 

### This week I learned about:
•	What are systems
•	Complex adaptive systems
•	Characteristics of complex adaptive systems

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Upon reflection, I learnt that systems are all around us and are integral for the function of society and technology. For example, cars contain many systems and can be classified as technical system. However, what was more fascinating was that even our society follows a system and can be classified as social system, e.g. following social norms. I also learned that reasons for social systems can include, to create roles, ranks and goals and objectives. While being obvious, it really opened up a realisation that systems are valuable for anything to work and be sustainable. Another great example that I learnt was through the case study of Bees. After reading this case study I understood that even Bees required a system in order to survive during a temperature change, hence amplifying the significance of systems. Something that I didn’t know until my workshop was that systems could also be classified as adaptive systems, indicating that they are able to adapt to survive and perform better.
What insights have I gained?

This week I gained many new insights. Firstly, I have understood the true significance of systems in real working spaces of information technology. Systems can be either complicated, which can predict outcomes or there are also complex outcomes that is constantly changing. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

From the first week of our workshop I understood that a strength of mine was the ability to understand the content well and successfully engage in discussions within UTS canvas. However, a weakness that I also saw within myself was the inability to be fully able to concentrate for 3 hours, however this was mitigated through regular breaks given, allowing us to recoupe again.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

From my first week of joining this workshop, the only issue faced was fully being engaged for 3 hours. I was able to handle this issue quite well because breaks were given out regularly. I observed that by having regular breaks I was able to concentrate more and contribute to the chat.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Haven’t started any assignments so far.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
So far, the understanding of complex adaptive systems and understanding of the different characteristics of complex adaptive systems has helped me understand the importance of systems within our lives and more importantly Information technology.



# Week 2 Reflection

## What have I learnt this week?
This week I learned about the use and importance of models in the simplification of complex ideas. I learnt that models could be used to present an idea in a clearer way for people and be used to create a strategy and design plans. 

## This week I learned about:

•	Models
•	Biases
•	Importance and use of models

## What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

Through the workshop I was able to understand the uses of models and how it differs to observations in an Information Systems environment. I learnt that while individuals may have similar thoughts, however everyone has individuals’ observations and it is key in a collaborative environment to express these observations. 

## What insights have I gained?

Through an experiment conducted within class I gained the insight that while ‘a face’ was easy to understand every individual had a different interpretation, therefore indicating the significance of drawing models to show these representations. I also found out that models could be used to interpret data and create strategies to improve the performance of a project or feature.

## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

So far, I have not observed any weaknesses within my workshop or with answering the discussion questions in the group thread. The strength that I have observed is my understanding of models and the functions of models that I can implement within my group assignment.

## What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?

So far, we have not encountered any challenges so far as we haven’t commenced our group task.

## What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

Haven’t gained any results so far.

## What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

Theory about modelling versus observation has really helped me understand the importance of creating models so that everyone is on the same understanding of the project and its requirements. This was further understood through the practical task of drawing faces which revealed that everyone had the same thoughts but different observations. Also the theory about what models are good to use such as Parsimony can be utilised for my future assignments.


# Week 3

What have I learnt this week?
This week was interesting because I learnt about models and how it actually played an integral role in individuals’ choices. This included in the form of rational and behavioural models which can be used to analyse people’s behaviours, biases and goals and its influence on their final decisions. This topic was fascinating because I didn’t realise that all humans used a bit of modelling to make decisions e,g. such as deciding to buy stocks today or next week. 

## This week I learned about:
-	Rational vs behavioural models
-	Ruled- based and adaptive
-	Decision making
-	 Multi-criteria decision 
-	Decision trees

## What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
A piece of information that I learnt was about signalling models. More specifically signalling and modelling. It was surprising to realise that these theory models applied in real life without me realising. For example, people drive expensive cars, wear expensive clothing for the purpose of creating a signal that symbolises wealth to others. These signals may be important factors for people who need to impress others. Also, this week I learnt the significance of a behavioural model and when analysing biases and external influence, I realised that with lower odds people tend to not take risks. However, when the odds are higher, or the prize is higher we tend to take it. This can be seen with individuals purchasing more lottery ticket, paying a higher prize in order to increase their odds of winning.

## What insights have I gained?
Throughout my learning of decision making I have understood the importance of models in addressing issues and problems. It has shown to be fundamental in making issues seen more clearly and easily interpreted. I have learnt that models can help identify and predict the behaviours of people based on previous information (positive reasons). 

## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
An immediate weakness I recognised while working on this assignment was the difficultly in fully understanding the applications of each model and its relevancy to my specific topic. It was important to differentiate the most useful models that provided detailed information rather than models that didn’t cover. A strength that I have seen is my communication presented within our group. By applying last semester’s methods of effective communication, we have assigned sections for each individual and set dates early for deadlines. I have also created a group chat so we are readily available to raise any issues and deal with it effectively.

## What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Didn’t have any results

## What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory that I have found to be useful was the different types models including behavioural and rule based. They seem to have a strong correlation to my topic. It was also quite interesting to learn that by analysing peoples trends we can create a model to predict how they might act.
